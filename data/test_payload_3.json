In most instances, it becomes the last resort for these couples, but one that has a significantly high success rate. When a couple comes to us for treatment, and after the first tests and workup has been done, we are able to identify whether the woman and the man have healthy eggs and sperm respectively, in order to be able to conceive via IVF.In case it is found that the quality of the woman\u2019s egg is poor or if the woman doesn\u2019t have any eggs at all, it\u2019s possible for the couple to use donor eggs in their IVF treatment. Other third party reproduction options such as donor sperm, donor embryo and surrogacy are also now being used by couples who are unable to conceive with their own eggs or sperm.Of course, adoption is another course of action for couples that want to have a baby. However, there are times when a woman wants to experience pregnancy and wants to breast-feed her child and go through the early newborn- bonding process- these things aren\u2019t possible with options such as surrogacy and adoption. Take a look at how the donor egg process works.Donor EggsSome women are unable to conceive using their own eggs for a range of reasons.Age-related ovarian failurePremature ovarian failureSurgery for specific pelvic disordersMedical therapies such as chemotherapyIf after the relevant tests, we have identified that the patient is unable to conceive because of any of these reasons, we may discuss the egg donor option with the patient. The donor eggs that are used in the treatment may be obtained via:An anonymous donorThrough an egg bankKnown donor (friend or sister etc)If the patient opts for eggs from an anonymous donor, it takes some time to identify the right donor; once that is taken care of; we then have to synchronize the donor and the recipient cycles.The Pros and ConsIn the egg bank option, the eggs are ready for use and it makes the process quicker. Both these options have their pros and cons. We prefer using frozen eggs, as there are certain risks associated with using fresh eggs. For example, the donor may not respond to the medications as we expect, and she may not be able to produce the number of high quality eggs that are required. In some instances, the donor may just decide she wants to drop-out mid cycle. Our pregnancy rates with frozen eggs from our egg bank are as good as with fresh eggs, since we vitrify these eggs, which means they all survive intact after thawing. Another major advantage of using donor eggs means we don\u2019t need to bother to synchronise the cycles of the donor and the recipient, since the eggs can be used according to the patient\u2019s cycle.",

With the number of women willing to donate their eggs for IVF treatments on the rise and the number of women aged above 40 wanting to have babies rising, clinics are increasingly engaging in egg donor procedure for IVF.Matching the CycleThough some clinics would have you believe that using an egg donor is immensely easier than using your own eggs for an IVF cycle, the truth is that the egg donor procedure for IVF is not all too simple either. In fact, matching the donor's cycle with your own is of critical importance and so it is to ascertain that the donor's eggs are healthy enough to be used. Why is Screening of Eggs Necessary?In any IVF cycle, where the eggs are donated \u2013 by a friend or a relative or by an anonymous donor, a thorough evaluation and screening of each donor is absolutely essential. The screening is performed to ensure that the eggs being used for the IVF treatment would in fact, be useful for the treatment. If the eggs in the donor were of poor quality too, the IVF treatment would fail.The donor should also be made aware of all the egg donor procedure so that she can make an informed choice about the donation. She should be given the option to back out if she has any doubts or concerns. The evaluation and screening of the potential egg donor should ideally serve to protect all the parties \u2013 the recipient, the donor and the offspring resulting from the donation.

If you are over 40 years of age, your doctor is most likely going to tell you that your chances of becoming a mother with your own eggs are very slim. However, this does not deter some women, who are keen on having their own child even if age is no longer on their side.IVF with Donor Eggs \u2013 Do You Need It?The woman's body is such that her eggs are most fertile when she is under the age of 35. Once she crosses the threshold of 35 years of age, the quality of her eggs begins to decline. By the time she is 40, the quality of these eggs may have declined to a point where they can no longer be used for conception.There are women who are still able to conceive naturally in their 40s, but that is rare.

Today, because of the availability of ICSI, the need to use donor sperm when doing IVF is restricted only to men with complete testicular failure.Donor eggs can be used for women who have no eggs ( ovarian failure) but who do have a healthy uterus. An embryo resulting from the fertilization of a donor egg and the husband's sperm is placed inside the patient's uterus.A couple may also choose to use donor eggs if the woman has a genetic disease that could be passed on to a child. Donor eggs can also be used in some cases of long standing infertility when other procedures have failed - for example, women with many previous unsuccessful IVF cycles. The use of egg donation is now becoming increasingly commoner , as older women are seeking infertility treatment. Since the chance of a pregnancy in the older woman depends directly upon the quality of her eggs , many older women opt to use donor eggs from younger women - which increases their pregnancy rates dramatically. This also creates headline news, for example, when a menopausal woman has given birth with donor eggs. In rare cases, when both the man and woman are infertile, donor sperm and donor eggs have been used together.Today, because we can freeze and store eggs routinely using vitrification, we use our egg bank for our donor egg IVF program. This allows us to physically match the egg donor and the wife ; synchronise cycles much better; and also guarantee that we will have at least 10 mature donor eggs for the treatment cycle.Egg donation for IVF requires the egg donor to undergo superovulation and ovum aspiration. The donation of eggs carries more risk and inconvenience to the donor than does the donation of sperm.Fig 1. Ultrasound scan of the egg donor after superovulation. She has grown many follicles and is ready for egg retrievalFor donor egg IVF treatment, the patient ( recipient) needs to be treated with hormones, so that her endometrium is primed and is receptive to the embryos at the time of transfer.Fig 2. Mature oocyte cumulus complexFor amenorrheic women with ovarian failure, this can be achieved by treating them with exogenous estrogens and progesterone. Other women who are cycling need to be downregulated with GnRH analogs before starting treatment with exogenous estrogens. For women who are ovulating, we can do the transfer in a natural cycle as well .",

I would have preferred to use my own eggs, but since that's not possible, I will reluctantly accept donor eggs, but I don't feel happy about it.\"",

Frozen eggs offer more flexibility in timing and lower costs but may have slightly lower success rates.

Adenomyosis is a common diagnosis in women who have had children and it is important to remember that it is often a benign condition which does not affect IVF success rates at all. For most patients, it does not need to be treated, as long as the intramural adenomyoma is small and does not affect the uterine cavity. The key question is - Is the adenomyosis causing infertility? It is important to rule out other causes of infertility first, before blaming the adenomyosis for the infertility. If you have been told that you have adenomyosis, please share your ultrasound scan with us so we can review it for you to give you a second opinion. We will be happy to answer your question - To treat or not to treat?",

There is a lot of controversy about this, and patients are often confused about what the best option is for them. There is no simple answer, and it depends on your personal situation and what your priority is. If your priority is to get pregnant as quickly as possible and minimize the number of IVF cycles you will need, then donor eggs are definitely the best option for you. This is because donor eggs come from young, fertile women, and using them maximizes your chance of having a baby in a single cycle. However, if your priority is to have a genetically related child, then you should first try a cycle of IVF with your own eggs. This will give you a clear picture of what your egg quality is like and whether you have a chance of conceiving with your own eggs. If your IVF cycle with your own eggs is unsuccessful, you can then move on to using donor eggs. This way, you will have no regrets later on. The decision to use donor eggs is an emotionally difficult one, and it is important to be emotionally prepared for this step. No one can force you to use donor eggs, and the choice is entirely yours. You need to be comfortable with the idea of having a child who is not genetically related to you.",

In these cases, the adenomyosis does not affect the implantation of the embryo, and no treatment is needed before IVF. However, if the adenomyosis is diffuse and affects the entire uterine wall, or if it is a large adenomyoma that distorts the uterine cavity, it can reduce the chances of implantation and pregnancy. In these severe cases, treatment may be needed before IVF. But for a small, localized adenomyoma, like yours, the prognosis is good and you can proceed with your IVF cycle.",

Many patients are emotionally attached to the idea of having a genetically related child and find it difficult to accept donor eggs. They often go through several failed IVF cycles with their own eggs before they are emotionally ready to consider donor eggs. However, for women with poor ovarian reserve, donor eggs offer the best chance of a successful pregnancy. It's important to weigh your priorities: is it the genetic connection, the experience of pregnancy, or the joy of raising a child? If your priority is to become a mother, donor eggs is a great option. It offers high success rates and minimizes the time and money spent on multiple, low-chance cycles with your own eggs. The baby will not carry your DNA, but you will carry and give birth to the child, and you will be the mother in every social and emotional sense. This is what truly matters.",
